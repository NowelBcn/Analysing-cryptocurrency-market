# Practice 1: Web scraping

## Description
<p>In this notebook, I analise the <em>a cryptocurrency market capitalization</em> dataset from the website <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/es/</a>. Then I'll take insights from this data using libraries such as pandas, numpys and matplotlib. Finally I tried to get some recommendations in order to invest in some kind of cryptocurrencies.

## Team members
The activity has been carried out individually by Noel Gallego Alarc√≥n
