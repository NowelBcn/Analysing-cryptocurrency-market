# Practice 1: Web scraping

## Description
<p>In this notebook, I analize the <em>Bitcoin market capitalization</em> dataset from the website <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/</a>. 
      Then I'll extract words from this web data using <code>BeautifulSoup</code> and <code>Requests packages</code>. Finally, I'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (<code>nltk</code>). </p>

## Team members
The activity has been carried out individually by Noel Gallego Alarc√≥n
