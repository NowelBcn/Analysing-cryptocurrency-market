# Practice 2:

## Description
<p>In this notebook, I analise a dataset of <em>Cryptocurrency market capitalization</em> from the website <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/es/"></a>. Then I analise figures from this web data using <code>Pandas</code> and <code>Matplotlib</code> mainly along with other dependencies sucha as numpy. Finally, I'll dive into analyzing the distribution of the data in order to extract some insights and trying to recommend some investments. </p>

## Team members
The activity has been carried out individually by Noel Gallego Alarc√≥n
